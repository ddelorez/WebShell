# Web SSH Terminal

A web-based SSH terminal that allows you to access your server's command line interface through a web browser with password authentication.

## Features

- **Web Interface:** Access your server via a user-friendly web terminal.
- **Password Authentication:** Secure access using your server's SSH credentials.
- **Real-time Interaction:** Execute commands and see outputs in real-time.
- **Dockerized:** The application is containerized for easy deployment and scalability.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Docker
- Git (if you want to clone the repository)

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/web-ssh-terminal.git
cd web-ssh-terminal

### Building the Docker Image

Build the Docker image for the application:

docker build -t web-ssh .

### Running the Application

Start the Docker container:

docker run --name web-ssh-app -p 5000:5000 -d web-ssh

If port 5000 is already in use, you can map to a different port:

docker run --name web-ssh-app -p 8080:5000 -d web-ssh

### Accessing the Application

Navigate to `http://localhost:5000` (or the port you've mapped to) in your web browser.

### Using the Terminal

- Enter your server's hostname, username, and password when prompted.
- Once connected, you can execute commands as if you were directly SSH'd into your server.

## Configuration

- **SSH Credentials**: The application currently prompts for SSH credentials for each session. For production use, consider implementing more secure authentication methods like SSH keys.
- **Environment Variables**: For sensitive information, use environment variables instead of hardcoding them in the application.

## Security Considerations

- **HTTPS**: Ensure your application runs over HTTPS in a production environment to secure the transmission of credentials.
- **Authentication**: Use SSH keys instead of passwords for enhanced security.
- **Session Management**: Implement proper session management to avoid unnecessary credential exposures.
